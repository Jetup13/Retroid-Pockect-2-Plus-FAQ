Congrats! You should now have Syncthing setup to sync your RetroArch saves on between your Retroid Pocket 2 Plus and PC.

_If your worried about battery drain or don't like the Syncthing notification on android simply swipe the bottom of the screen up > recent apps button (square button) > swipe the synching card up to close app. Just make sure to load into to the app for your saves to sync. Same goes for your desktop. It will only sync if your desktop is on and the app is running._
