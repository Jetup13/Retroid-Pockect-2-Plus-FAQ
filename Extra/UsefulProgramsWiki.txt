# CDMage

[CDMage](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1435/) is a useful program to use if (for some reason) you don't want to use CHD files but want single bin/cue files for your disc based games. The program has more usages such as extracting files from a game.

Simply Load Cue > File > Save As > (Don't change track modes) Ok

# CHDMan

CHD is a compressed file format. It can be used for various emulators and is quite useful to save on space. You can use CHDMan to convert your bin/cue, bin/gdi, or iso files to chd.

[Download](https://github.com/Jetup13/Retroid-Pocket-2-Plus-Wiki/blob/main/Extra/chdman.zip)

Simply place your bin/cue, gdi, or iso files into the same folder as CHDMan and run this command or use the bat file included

> CUE/GDI/ISO to CHD (Standard)
```
for /r %%i in (*.cue, *.gdi, *.iso) do chdman createcd -i "%%i" -o "%%~ni.chd"
```

If for some reason you're getting a performance hit using chd try this instead:

> CUE/GDI/ISO to CHD (disabled LZMA)
```
for /r %%i in (*.cue, *.gdi, *.iso) do chdman createcd -i "%%i" -o "%%~ni.chd" -c cdzl,cdfl
```

# namDHC

[namDHC](https://github.com/umageddon/namDHC) is a chdman frontend. Great for those that want a user interface to convert their disc games to chd format.

# PNGoo

[PNGoo](https://pngquant.org/PNGoo.0.1.1.zip) is a lossy PNG compressor program. It can be used to compress or png files down with losing much quality. This is extremely useful when cutting down file sizes of cover art.

_If your worried about battery drain or don't like the Syncthing notification on android simply swipe the bottom of the screen up > recent apps button (square button) > swipe the synching card up to close app. Just make sure to load into to the app for your saves to sync. Same goes for your desktop. It will only sync if your desktop is on and the app is running._
