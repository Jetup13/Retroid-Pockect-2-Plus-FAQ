# Input

The Retroid Pocket 2 Plus has two controller style: `Xbox` and `Retro`. If you enjoy the A button (Right) as your select/accept then choose `Retro`. I'd recommend sticking with `Xbox` for game and app compatibility.

To set input style or check other input related options: `Android setting > Handheld Settings > Input`
