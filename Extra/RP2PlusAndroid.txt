# Hide images in gallery

Tired of emulators creating tons of images in your picture gallery? Create a [.nomedia](https://github.com/Jetup13/Retroid-Pocket-2-Plus-Wiki/blob/main/Extra/.nomedia) file. It will hide every image in the same folder (+ subfolders).

# Input

The Retroid Pocket 2 Plus has two controller style: `Xbox` and `Retro`. If you enjoy the A button (Right) as your select/accept then choose `Retro`. I'd recommend sticking with `Xbox` for game and app compatibility.

To set input style or check other input related options: `Android setting > Handheld Settings > Input`

To enable virtual mouse mode simply hold the Home button for 3 seconds. To disable hold the Home button again for 3 seconds
